# TinTin_chatbot

The Internet has evolved and revolutionized the world in only the last two decades. As you are reading this line at the moment, hundreds of millions people
are also surfing the net. Despite being able to be connected from anywhere on
the globe, it is a firm belief that people are the loneliest in this technology era.
Building a chatbot has been one of my interests for so long, so this is a
chance for me to really look into the subject. At first, the idea came to me as
some sort of a hobby, then it dawned on me that a chatbot has become a
need in the technology world. My simple motivation for this project is to build a
wholesome friend that is always ready for us to talk to when needed.
I am going to build a real-time chatbot web server using mainly Python. At
start, users can chat with my chatbot on a website in the local network. The
chatbot is for entertainment purpose. It can serve everyday conversation and
make small talk. I will build a chatbot using Chatterbot (a Python library) and
then I use Flask (Python web framework) to build both front-end and back-end
of the website. I will also implement WebSocket to deal with real-time messaging and handle multiple connections. As an extra step, I would like to be able
to deploy the chatbot onto the public server for people to be able to talk to it.
The resource needed for this project is one computer with Visual Studio Code
installed.
